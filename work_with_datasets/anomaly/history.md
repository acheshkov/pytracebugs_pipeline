## 2. Embeddings

- Use `microsoft/graphcodebert-base` pretrained `RobertaModel` from `huggingface`
- Embedding is an averaged 768-dimensional vector from the last layer

  1. Software code review aims to early find code anomalies and to perform code improvements when they are less expensive. However, issues and challenges faced by developers who do not apply code review practices regularly are unclear.
  2. The main objectives of code review are finding code anomalies (code smells), and performing code improvements in terms of readability, commenting, consistency, and dead code removal.
  3. Surveys conducted with developers who regularly use code review practices indicate that developers spend 10-15 percent of their time in code reviews.
  4. What is the best moment to warn software developers regarding code anomalies?
  5. Practitionersâ€™ perception is that multiple metric thresholds should be used in source code quality analysis. Current static analysis tools use a single metric threshold value for each metric. Metric thresholds are used by detection strategies to identify code anomalies. However, our results showed that only 9.14% of the respondents declared to agree with a single metric threshold to evaluate all system classes
