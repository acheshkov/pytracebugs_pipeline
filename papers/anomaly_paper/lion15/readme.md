## [Call for papers](https://lion15.sba-research.org/submission.html#cfp)

### Paper Format

Please prepare your paper in English using the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) [template](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines?countryChanged=true).
Papers must be submitted in PDF.

### Types of Submissions

When submitting a paper to LION15, authors are required to select one of the following three types of papers:
- Long paper: original novel and unpublished work (max. 15 pages in LNCS format);
- **Short paper**: an extended abstract of novel work (max. 6 pages in LNCS format);
- Work for oral presentation only (no page restriction; any format). For example, work already published elsewhere, which is relevant and which may solicit fruitful discussion at the conference.

### Topics of Interest

LION15 welcomes high quality submissions on the broad topics of machine learning, artificial intelligence, energy, mathematical programming, optimization (models, algorithms and applications) and heuristics. Additionally, more specialized, submission topics for long and short papers may include, but are not limited to:

- automatic solver configuration
- parallel methods for search and optimization
- hard combinatorial optimization problems
- intelligent optimization in health, e-health, bioinformatics and neurosciences
- machine learning and optimization methods in tourism and hospitality
- nature-inspired algorithms for combinatorial optimization problems
- hard combinatorial optimization problems in combinatorics, computational geometry and machine learning
- DC (difference of convex functions) learning: theory, algorithms and applications
- computational intelligence for smart cities
- computational intelligence for autonomous driving
- optimization and management in smart manufacturing
- algorithms and applied optimization for environmental data science
- machine learning and robust optimization techniques in finance applications
- **machine learning and optimization methods in software engineering**
