In that time, the software has been rewritten entirely from scratch, evolved substantially and now accompanies a text on data mining [35]. These days, WEKA enjoys widespread acceptance in both academia and business, has an active community, and has been downloaded more than 1.4 million times since being placed on Source-Forge in April 2000. This paper provides an introduction to the WEKA workbench, reviews the history of the project, and, in light of the recent 3.6 stable release, briefly discusses what has been added since the last stable version (Weka 3.4) released in 2003.},

abstract = {The recently introduced continuous Skip-gram model is an efficient method for learning high-quality distributed vector representations that capture a large number of precise syntactic and semantic word relationships. In this paper we present several extensions that improve both the quality of the vectors and the training speed. By subsampling of the frequent words we obtain significant speedup and also learn more regular word representations. We also describe a simple alternative to the hierarchical softmax called negative sampling.An inherent limitation of word representations is their indifference to word order and their inability to represent idiomatic phrases. For example, the meanings of "Canada" and "Air" cannot be easily combined to obtain "Air Canada". Motivated by this example, we present a simple method for finding phrases in text, and show that learning good vector representations for millions of phrases is possible.},

abstract = {We present Bugs.jar, a large-scale dataset for research in automated debugging, patching, and testing of Java programs. Bugs.jar is comprised of 1,158 bugs and patches, drawn from 8 large, popular open-source Java projects, spanning 8 diverse and prominent application categories. It is an order of magnitude larger than Defects4J, the only other dataset in its class. We discuss the methodology used for constructing Bugs.jar, the representation of the dataset, several use-cases, and an illustration of three of the use-cases through the application of 3 specific tools on Bugs.jar, namely our own tool, Elixir, and two third-party tools, Ekstazi and JaCoCo.},
