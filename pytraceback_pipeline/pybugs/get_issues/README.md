# Collecting and processing Github repositories issues

This folder contains three subfolders:
* `src` - basic functions for collecting issues
* `tests` - tests for those functions.

There is a basic convention in naming of functions in the modules:
if a function name starts with the underscore `_` symbol, this function is 
for internal use in some other function.
